# Indoor Air Quality Monitoring and Warning System

![System Demo](demo.gif)

## Description
The Indoor Air Quality Monitoring and Warning System is a project developed for monitoring and analyzing indoor air quality in real-time. It utilizes Arduino Uno R4 WiFi microcontroller along with various sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality, and more. The collected data is processed using Python and stored in MongoDB Atlas for further analysis. The system features both desktop and web interfaces for user interaction, providing real-time visualization of air quality metrics and alerts.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of indoor air quality
- Wireless data transmission via Bluetooth Low Energy
- Data processing and analysis using Python libraries
- User-friendly desktop and web interfaces
- Historical data tracking and trend analysis
- Integration with MongoDB Atlas for data storage

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Connect the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi and sensors
4. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Usage
- Access the desktop interface by running the GUI application.
- Open the web interface by navigating to the provided URL.
- Monitor real-time air quality metrics and receive alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
- Analyze historical data using visualization tools and MongoDB queries.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional sensors for comprehensive monitoring
- Development of predictive models for proactive alerts
- Creation of a mobile application for remote monitoring
- Enhancement of hardware setup and user interfaces
